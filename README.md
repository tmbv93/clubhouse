# Codename: Milkshake
A simple, free, open-source system to manage your business, group or organisation -- whether you're incorporated or not.

## Inquiries?
This project is maintained by Tomas! Reach out to me on tomasbv@hey.com

## How to get the project up and running
Proper instructions will come later, but it's a Ruby on Rails project, so install Ruby, Rails, run bundle, migrate DB etc.

## Contribute
Feel free to explore the code and submit pull requests. It's early days, and proper processes will be formalised.
It's a good idea to reach out to Tomas first if you have a bigger idea you want to add to the project.

## License
Protected under the JGTHF (Just Give Tomas a Heads-up First) license, in case you want to use the code 
for something radically different from the scope of this app/project.
